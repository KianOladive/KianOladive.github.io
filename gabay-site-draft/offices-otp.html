                <h1>Code of Internal Procedures on LOA and Resignation</h1>
                <p>The recently crafted CIP is an administrative document that aims to support the officers intending to take a leave of absence or submit a formal resignation from their positions in the organization. It details the operational terms—complementing the Ateneo Gabay Constitution—and processes per classified and non-classified forms of filing. As Gabay pushes for a more inclusive and supportive community, the CIP hopes to dispel confusion about the systems in place for such concerns, especially in protecting member health and maintaining the quality of work and advocacy.</p>

                <h1>Executive Committee Assessment and Public Perception Survey</h1>
                <p>The periodic assessments and surveys provide an opportunity for Gabay officers and the General Assembly to share their insights on the trajectory of the organization and its Executive Committee. It aims to look at Gabay through the lens of people who are active contributors, participants, and even observers—to diversify the perspectives in gauging the success of our advocacy and ensuring that the projects are member-centric.</p>

                <h1>Deputy Get Together and General Assembly</h1>
                <p>Gabay General Assemblies are brief programs that provide a platform for the members and officers to get to know the organization and its plans for the year. In tandem, the Office of the President also plans gatherings—Gabay Get Togethers—throughout the year to provide a space for members and officers to bond outside work, with fun activities and interactive efforts.</p>

                <h1>Freshman Representatives Elections</h1>
                <p>Scheduled right after Recruitment Week, the FRep Elections is a period wherein newbie freshman Gabayanos are invited to represent their batch and act as primary communicators for their insights and concerns throughout the year. It also allows the freshmen to exercise their rights to vote as part of the General Assembly, electing leaders who will support their adjustment as new member-advocates.</p>

                <h1>Planning and Formation Seminar</h1>
                <p>The semestral Planning and Leadership Formation Seminars are avenues with which the General Assembly can involve themselves in planning the organization’s future trajectory. Consequently, it also acts as a way for them to tap their leadership potential as future leaders of Gabay through leadership-training, commitment-sharing, and capacity-building activities.</p>

                <h1>Executive Committee Elections</h1>
                <p>The Executive Committee Elections is a much-awaited period where aspiring Gabayanos present themselves to the General Assembly as candidates for the next set of Gabay leadership in the upcoming year. Through discernment sessions, miting de avance, and campaigning, the Ateneo Gabay COMELEC ensures a fair and insightful election, through events that communicate the intent and platforms of the candidates—like discernment sessions and miting de avance—and appropriate time to cast and verify their votes.</p>
