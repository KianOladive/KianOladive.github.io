                    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                    <h2>Who are the members?</h2>
                    <p>Ateneo Gabay is a community of students who are passionate about advocating and providing opportunities for quality education to our sectors, Atenean scholars and public elementary school kids.</p>

                    <h2>Who do we serve?</h2>
                    <p>We serve the Atenean scholar community and public elementary school students (Erya Kids) - particularly those from Holy Spirit Elementary School and Industrial Valley Elementary School.</p>

                    <h2>How do we serve our sectors?</h2>
                    <p>In the service of our sectors, we initiate programs catered for their welfare and development. For example, the Gabay Erya Formation Program is a weekly tutorial class in Mathematics and English for public elementary school kids in Grade 4 - 6. In addition to that, several scholar adjustment programs, such as Salubong, the freshman scholars' welcoming event, and the Scholar's Support Group, have been created for our Atenean scholar sector.
                    <br><br>
                    In the present context, given that students are currently in distance learning, Ateneo Gabay also adjusted its services to the sectors. Erya Hotline was launched earlier in 2021 to provide online and text support to students on their modules, even outside Mathematics and English. Furthermore, Ateneo Gabay conducts fundraisers for both sectors such as Share-ya and Art For A Cause.</p>

                    <h2>How does Gabay unify its advocacy to its service?</h2>
                    <p>The Ateneo Gabay Advocacy Module was created by SY 2018-2019 Externals Vice President Lea Cabeliza, deputies Lorenzo Lazaro and Igor Garcia, and former deputy Gabriel Arriola.
                    <br><br>
                    Ateneo Gabay was a reputed scholar's community in the past, as it did provide a family to its members. However, it was realized that our image should be more than just a community, but also a sector-based organization that does more to push for quality education to those who are more in need.
                    <br><br>
                    As such, the much-needed externalization started from the inside, and the Advocacy Module was created. This module relates our advocacy to all our efforts and contains both its overall and specific integration to different Gabay projects. Through this module, members themselves can have a clear picture of how they can live out our advocacy.</p>

                    <h2>What more can we expect regarding our advocacy?</h2>
                    <p>Stay tuned for Ateneo Gabay's advocacy crash course. This will provide a better and concise picture of how our advocacy continues to be present in our activities and projects, whether they are conducted onsite or online. This crash course is an initiative of Kurt de los Santos, Externals SY 2021-2022 Externals Vice President, as well as Charles Opague, JLove Rivera, and Hosea Encarnacion, the Deputies for Advocacy Formation.</p>
