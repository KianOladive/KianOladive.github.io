        <a href="eighteen/eighteen-things.html">link</a>
                    I am Kian Angelo M. Oladive, a 20-year-old college student 
                    from Mandaluyong. I am currently studying Computer Science 
                    in the hopes of landing a Software Engineering job in the 
                    future, which I think is the line of work that best suits 
                    my strengths and skills, and one that I would thoroughly 
                    enjoy.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    I have always been fond of Math, thus leading me to choose a 
                    degree program that is essentially applied mathematics. I 
                    chose Computer Science because somewhere along the way, I 
                    developed a liking towards tech, and while it isn’t as strong 
                    as it once was, the fire is still alive.
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    I like learning and the challenge that it brings. I have 
                    always seen this as one of my key strengths, as this has led 
                    me to the pursuit of excellence in whatever I bring my mind 
                    to. I believe that my greatest weakness is time management, 
                    and this is something that I am always working towards.

                <p> 
                    I attended this elementary school from 2007-2013, where I 
                    graduated as First Honorable Mention.

                <p> 
                    Apart from being the nearest high school from my house, 
                    CMSHS also supposedly bred the most talented and gifted 
                    students of the city through its special science and technology 
                    curriculum. I had a lot of fun and great memories from MandSci 
                    that helped shaped me into the person I am today. High School, 
                    to me, was one big learning experience. I graduated both Junior 
                    and Senior High School with Honors.

                <p> 
                    I am currently in my 3rd year of Computer Science at Ateneo 
                    de Manila University. While it wasn’t my first choice for 
                    college in High School, I’m glad I decided on choosing the 
                    nurturing, highly learning-conducive, and self-developing 
                    environment that Ateneo established within its walls. 
                    Choosing Ateneo may just be the best decision of my life 
                    thus far. I love it here and I’m excited for what the future 
                    holds.
