				<h1 class = "about-text"> About Me </h1>
				<p>Hi there!! I'm Kian Oladive, a sophommore from AdMU taking up Computer Science. I'm from Mandaluyong and the second of three children. I love dogs and watching K-Dramas. As you can probably imagine, I spend a lot of time in front of my computer (especially now) so I'm always online and ready to talk. Hit me up if you have anything to say to me! </p>

				<section class = "basketball-text">
					<h1>1. Basketball</h1>
					<p>I first played basketball in 8th grade. It was one of the first times where I was willing to do bad in school just so I could play. I had a lot of fun school-after-hours-memories with my friends that I will treasure forever. Here are some photos of me and my teammates in our high school varsity team.</p>

					<h1>2. Cubing</h1>
					<p>Like basketball, I also started getting into cubing during 8th grade. It was when I saw a guy at school do it really fast. On that very day, I bought a cube myself and watched a tutorial. I used to practice multiple hours every day. After 2 years, I was selected to represent the school at a city-wide competition. Fortunately, I was able to win first place. Since then, it became more of a casual thing for me and I've gotten a bit slower. Here's a photo of me holding a cube as well as a 5x5, my favorite puzzle currently.</p>

					<h1>3. Gaming</h1>
					<p>Recently, I got into gaming, specifically Valorant. I was just too bored in the ECQ one day that i decided to try it out. I ended up getting addicted to it for a bit. Since the start of classes, I have slowed down on gaming a bit. Here are my 2 favorite agents right now--Omen and Phoenix.</p>

				<section class = "chess-text">
					<h1>4. Chess</h1>
					<p>I learned to play chess in 4th grade after a few of my elementary friends taught me how the pieces moved. I found the game so interesting that I convinced my parents to buy me a board and I'd challenge our old neighbors. Because of all this experience, I represented my schools both on the elementary and high school levels. Here's a photo of me playing my last game in the 2017 Division Meet. Also the guy in black & white is Mikhail Tal, my favorite player <3.</p>

					<h2>Ants</h2>
					<p>I find ants to be very interesting creatures because of how well they work together. Given the chance, I would love to try and handle them on my own.</p>

				<article class = "pen-interest">
					<img src="pen-spin.gif">
					<h2>Pen-Spinning</h2>
					<p>I have always found pen-spinning to be very cool. One of these days, I'll pull up a YouTube tutorial and learn it myself!</p>

					<h2>Physics</h2>
					<p>One of my best friends from high school is currently a Physics major. H told me this cool thing about this sort of divide between physical and conceptual physics that seemed really interesting. </p>

			<section class = "bottom-pane">
				<article class = "lock-interest">
					<img src="lock.jpg">
					<h2>Lock-Picking</h2>
					<p>Lock-picking will always appeal to me as a skill that I could potentianlly use in an emergency situation. This started when I was young as I feared getting kidnapped and being trapped in a locked room.</p>

				<article class = "whistle-interest">
					<img src="whistle.jpg">
					<h2>Finger-whistling</h2>
					<p>Finger whistling is something that I've tried before, but failed. I was just bad at it. I'll maybe keep trying in the future, though.</p>
				</article>
				<article class = "pseudo-interest">
					<img src="pseudo.jpg">
					<h2>Pseudo-slotting</h2>
					<p>Pseudo-slotting is a technique in the first two layers phase of solving a Rubik's Cube. Although this concept will take a lot of patience, I'm willing to give it a shot... someday.</p>
